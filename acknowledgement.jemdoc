I am grateful to the following people for helping me over the years (alphabetical order):
- [http://ccst.jlu.edu.cn/info/1205/5307.htm Shang Gao], I got A+ in both of his courses of /Massive Data Mining and Analysis/ and /Optimization Algorithms/ in Jilin University, and then began my very first research on optimization with application in performance evaluation.
- [https://www.cs.huji.ac.il/~yupan/ Yupan Liu], it is his answers and articles on zhihu that aroused my interests in TCS in the very beginning and encouraged me to start studying and doing research in TCS.
- Zong Shang, my best friend in Jilin University, the most talented, insightful and hard-working man I have ever seen, who introduced me to the fields of statistical learning theory, asymptotic convex geometry and other fields in modern mathematics, and always gives me encouragement, advice and help in both research and life.
- [http://guangxu-yang.github.io/ Guangxu Yang], who introduced me to the fields of communication complexity and other fields in TCS, taught me how to study and do research, and always gives me encouragement, advice and help in research and life.
