~~~
I am grateful to the following people for helping me over the years:
- [http://guangxu-yang.github.io/ Guangxu Yang], one of the two men I am most grateful to, who introduced me to the fields of communication complexity and other fields in TCS, taught me how to study and do research, and always gives me encouragement, advice and help in research.
- Zong Shang, the other one of the two men I am most grateful to, my best friend in Jilin University, the most talented, insightful and hard-working man I have ever seen, who introduced me to the fields of statistical learning theory, asymptotic convex geometry and other fields in modern mathematics, and always gives me encouragement, advice and help in both research and life.
- [https://www.cs.huji.ac.il/~yupan/ Yupan Liu], it is his answers and articles on zhihu that aroused my interests in TCS in the very beginning and encouraged me to start studying and doing research in TCS.
- [http://ccst.jlu.edu.cn/info/1205/5307.htm Shang Gao], I got A+\/A in both of his courses of /Massive Data Mining and Analysis/ and /Optimization Algorithms/ in Jilin University, and then began my very first research on optimization and performance evaluation advised by him.
- [https://www.math.ias.edu/avi/home Avi Wigderson], the theoretical computer scientist who I most admire and most want to be like, although he even doesn't know me.
- [/index.html Myself], who reminds me never to give up my dreams, no matter how hard it will be.
