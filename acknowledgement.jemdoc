- Zong Shang, the other one of the two man I am most grateful to, my best friend in Jilin University, the most talented, insightful and hard-working man I have ever seen, who introduced me to the fields of statistical learning theory and other fields in modern mathematics, and always gives me encouragement and help in both research and life.

- [http://ccst.jlu.edu.cn/info/1205/5307.htm Shang Gao], I got A+\/A in both of his course about /Advanced Algorithms/ and /Convex Optimization/, and then began my very first research on cloud computing and optimization advised by him.
