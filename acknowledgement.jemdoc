~~~
I am grateful to the following people for helping me over the years:
- [http://guangxu-yang.github.io/ Guangxu Yang], one of the two men I am most grateful to, who introduced me to the fields of communication complexity and other fields in TCS, taught me how to study and do research, and always gives me encouragement, advice and help in research.
- Zong Shang, the other one of the two men I am most grateful to, my best friend in Jilin University, the most talented, insightful and hard-working man I have ever seen, who introduced me to the fields of statistical learning theory and other fields in modern mathematics, and always gives me encouragement, advice and help in both research and life.
- [https://www.cs.huji.ac.il/~yupan/ Yupan Liu], it is his answers and articles on zhihu that arouse my interests in TCS in the very beginning and encourage me to start doing research in TCS.
- [http://ccst.jlu.edu.cn/info/1205/5307.htm Shang Gao], I got A+\/A in both of his course about /Advanced Algorithms/ and /Convex Optimization/, and then began my very first research on optimization and cloud computing advised by him.
