Here is my [documents/CV_Yilin_Yan.pdf CV].

My ErdÅ‘s number is $\infty$. ðŸ¤£
~~~

== NEW
~~~
I am now looking for an *Internship \/ Master \/ Ph.D.* position in theoretical computer science \/ learning theory starts in any time!
~~~

== Research Interests
~~~
{Generally}
I am broadly interested in theoretical computer science, learning theory and their subtle intersections, with a focus on designing efficient andelegant algorithms with theoretical guarantees, using tools from both TCS and modern
mathematics.
~~~

~~~
{Particularly}
I am most interested in (see the [/statement.html Statement] for more details):
- Online optimization and online learning.
- Sublinear algorithms and communication complexity-derived lower bounds.
~~~

~~~
{Currently}
I am now working on (see the [/projects.html Projects] for more details):
- Smoothed Online Convex Optimization, Convex Bodies Chasing and Applications in Cloud Resource Provisioning (2021.2â€“present)
~~~

~~~
{Future}
There are many potential topics I am interested in and may work on in the future:
- Adversarially Robust Streaming and Sampling Algorithms
- Beyond Worst-Case Analysis and Learning-Augmented Algorithms
