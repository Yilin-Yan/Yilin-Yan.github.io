My name is Yilin Yan (in Simplified Chinese: ä¸¥ç¥Žéœ–).

I am a third-year undergradute student in Honors Program in Science (Computer Science Track), Jilin University, China.

My ErdÅ‘s number is $\infty$. ðŸ¤£
~~~

== NEW
~~~
*I am looking for a Ph.D. position in theoretical computer science starting in 2022\/2023!*
~~~

== Research Interests
~~~
{Generally}
I am broadly interested in theoretical computer science and its applications in real world, with a focus on designing efficient and elegant algorithms with theoretical guarantees, using various tools from both theoretical computer science and modern mathematics.
~~~

~~~
{Particularly}
I am now interested in geometric algorithms with restricted resources (see the [/statement.html Statement] for more details), especially in online decision making and algorithmic convex geometry.
~~~

~~~
{Currently}
I am now working on (see the [/projects.html Projects] for more details):
- When Chasing Convex Bodies Meets Smoothed Online Convex Optimization (2021.5â€“present)
~~~

~~~
{Tentatively}
I am planning to choose one from below as next research topic:
- Streaming algorithms and communication complexity-derived lower bounds
- Operator scaling and spectral method
