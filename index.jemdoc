== NEW
~~~
I am now looking for an *Internship \/ Master \/ Ph.D.* position in theoretical computer science \/ learning theory starts in any time!
~~~

== Research Interests
~~~
{Generally}
I am broadly interested in theoretical computer science, learning theory and their subtle intersections, with a focus on designing efficient and elegant algorithms with theoretical guarantees, using tools from both TCS and modern mathematics.
~~~

~~~
{Particularly}
I am most interested in (see the [/statement.html Statement] for more details):
- Online decision making and algorithmic convex geometry.
- Sublinear algorithms and communication complexity-derived lower bounds.
~~~

~~~
{Currently}
I am now working on (see the [/projects.html Projects] for more details):
- Smoothed Online Convex Optimization and Convex Bodies Chasing (2021.2â€“present)
