== About me
~~~
I am a third year undergradute student in Honors Program in Science (Computer Science Track), Jilin University, China.

*I am now looking for an Internship \/ Master \/ Ph.D. position in theoretical computer science \/ machine learning theory starts in any time!* ðŸ˜‰

Here is my [CV_Yilin_Yan.pdf CV].

My ErdÅ‘s number is $\infty$. ðŸ¤£
~~~

== Research interests
~~~
I am broadly interested in *theoretical computer science* and *machine learning theory*, with a focus on their intersections and designing efficient algorithms with theoretical guarantees. 
~~~

~~~
In particular, I am interested in (see the [statement.html Research Statement] for more details):
- Algorithms for large-scale data, namely, sublinear algorithms, including streaming algorithms (sublinear space), property testing (sublinear time) and compressed sensing (sublinear measurement), with techniques for lower bounds for these problems, specifically, communication complexity-derived lower bounds.
- Algorithms under uncertainty, specifically, online decision making in the face of an ever-changing (and sometimes even adversarial) environment, including online learning and online optimization.
- Behavior of algorithms in practice, which motivates Beyond worst-case analysis, e.g., Smoothed analysis, and new paradigms of algorithms design, e.g., Learning-Augmented Algorithms.
- Algorithms design using tools from modern mathematics, specifically, probabilistic method, spectral graph theory, asymptotic convex geometry and geometry of polynomials.
~~~

~~~
Currently, I am working on:
- Smoothed Online Convex Optimization in Cloud Computing
- Adversarially Robust Sampling and Streaming Algorithm
