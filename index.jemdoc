I am most interested in (see the [/statement.html Statement] for more details):
- Sublinear algorithms and communication complexity-derived lower bounds.
- Online optimization and online learning.
~~~

~~~
{Currently}
I am working on (see the [/projects.html Projects] for more details):
- Smoothed Online Convex Optimization in Cloud Resource Provisioning (2021.2â€“present)
- Adversarially Robust Sampling and Streaming Algorithm (2021.6â€“present)
